      <title>Cloudflare Tunneling to Internal Resources with Cloudflared</title>

      <description>Introduction This post will cover how to set up a Docker container of Cloudflared on your internal network to provide a private tunnel from Cloudflare to your internal resources. After setting up the Cloudflared tunnels, you will no longer need to expose ports 80 and 443.
This post assumes you currently have a vibrant and functioning internal network with a reverse proxy (in my case, Nginx Proxy Manager) already configured.</description>

      <title>&#39;Split-Brain DNS&#39; for Internal HTTPS with Let&#39;s Encrypt</title>

      <description>Introduction In this previous post, I showed how to connect to a Unifi router with HTTPS, effectively ridding you of the tedious words, &amp;ldquo;Your connection is not private.&amp;rdquo; However, the method shown in that post directs your connection to an external DNS server (e.g., CloudFlare) in order to resolve your Unifi router. This adds some latency by requiring your traffic to flow out and in rather than staying local. Additionally, it requires opening some ports externally.</description>

      <title>Manage Linux Logs on AlienVault OSSIM</title>

      <description>Introduction OSSIM is a powerful open source security information and event management (SIEM) operating system. AlienVault OSSIM is the open source version of AlienVault, which is sold by AT&amp;amp;T.
I have used OSSIM in professional deployments in the past, and I currently use OSSIM for vulnerability scanning, asset management, and security alerts. OSSIM can often be overly complicated to set up and install, and the documentation available for troubleshooting is sparse.</description>

      <title>Run Graylog with Docker Compose on Unraid</title>

      <description>Introduction Logging and traffic monitoring are of utmost importance in information security. Having searchable stored logs can allow visibility into a variety of critical activities related to a data breach.
For example, individual computer event logs can provide insight into an attacker&amp;rsquo;s lateral movement within an environment. Active Directory authentication logs can provide more detail into this lateral movement and even help to establish a timeline of this movement. Firewall logs can provide insight into an attacker&amp;rsquo;s first contact or the first time an attacker utilized a particular command or control domain.</description>

      <title>How to Access Twitter Without an Account, Anonymously</title>

      <description>Interestingly, after my previous post describing how to route Docker containers through VPN on Unraid, I received a substantial lot of questions via email about my hints at accessing Twitter anonymously. This post is my response to those questions, and I will describe my workflow to access Twitter feeds anonymously, without an account.
This post will assume you have read my post on how to route Docker containers through VPN on Unraid or that you already know how to accomplish this.</description>

      <title>How to Route Any Docker Container Through VPN in Unraid</title>

      <guid>/posts/how-to-route-any-docker-container-through-vpn-in-unraid/</guid>
      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s post will cover how you can route any Docker container through a VPN.
There are many reasons you might want to route a Docker container through a VPN. Some common considerations are privacy, anonymity, and security.
I always recommend a VPN provider that values privacy, and in your search, you should consider providers that do not keep access logs that can be tied back to you (I use Private Internet Access [PIA]).</description>

      <title>How to Run AlienVault OSSIM as a VM on Unraid</title>
      <link>/posts/how-to-run-alienvault-ossim-as-a-vm-on-unraid/</link>

      <guid>/posts/how-to-run-alienvault-ossim-as-a-vm-on-unraid/</guid>
      <description>Introduction For this post, I will show you how to setup Unraid to run AlienVault OSSIM as a VM. OSSIM is a powerful open-source SIEM that you can leverage on your network for free. I use OSSIM for network-wide vulnerability scanning and endpoint host intrusion detection.
OSSIM&amp;rsquo;s integrated HIDS is a fork from OSSEC. Additionally, OSSIM integrates with Open Threat Exchange (OTX), which can be installed on Windows, Mac, and Linux endpoints and servers for an up-to-date, open-source vulnerability scanning tool.</description>

      <title>How to Connect to Your Unifi Dream Machine or UNVR with SSL from Let&#39;s Encrypt</title>

      <description>Update 05/09/2022: The conclusions of this post will route your traffic externally, requiring your local devices to reach external DNS servers (e.g., in my case, CloudFlare) in order to resolve your Unifi Gateway address. If you want to handle all of this completely locally/internally, check out my newer post: HTTPS for Internal Resources
Alright, if you have a Unifi device like a Dream Machine, Dream Machine Pro, UNVR, CloudKey, or other device, you likely have been met with the dreaded red triangle followed by the tedious words, &amp;ldquo;Your connection is not private.</description>

      <title>How to Add VLAN Segmentation for HomeKit IoT Devices with Unifi</title>

      <description>IoT Overview The smart world of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices is ever growing. From everyday lightbulbs to the sprinkler out front, just about every household appliance and utility has a smart-counterpart. For example, my smart home is fully Apple HomeKit compatible and consists of a Hue bridge with lightbulbs, Lutron Caseta smart dimmers/switches, Eve Aqua outdoor water hose control, iSmartGate garage door opener, Schlage deadbolt, Eve motion sensor, Sonos speakers throughout the house, a Vocolinc oil diffuser, Vocolionc power strip, a couple iRobot Roomba vacuum cleaners, some Vocolinc pluggable outlets, an Ecobee thermostat to replace each analog thermostat in the house, and a Unifi G4 Doorbell (the doorbell is not technically compatible with HomeKit, but I added support with a third-party tool known as &amp;ldquo;Homebridge&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <title>How to Harden Your Network Security for Your In-Home Web Hosting</title>

      <description>Overview The purpose of this post is to provide some tips to address some network security concerns when hosting an externally-facing web server from a device within your home network. For this post, I will be using Unifi networking gear. My screenshots will be of the Unifi controller on myÂ Unifi Dream Machine Pro (UDMP), but I will do my best to overview the concepts so you can replicate with your own networking gear.</description>

      <title>How to Use pfSense and Unifi to Anonymize and Encrypt VLAN Tagged Traffic</title>

      <description>This post aims to show you how to use pfSense within a Unifi network behind a Unifi Gateway [in my case, the gateway is the Unifi Dream Machine Pro (hereafter referred to as UDMP)]. I will explain my current network configuration including applicable subnets, VLANs, and wireless SSIDs needed to make this setup successful. The end goal is to be able to add a client on my Unifi network to a particular VLAN either by joining this client wirelessly to a particular SSID or by tagging the client&amp;rsquo;s physical port to that VLAN.</description>
