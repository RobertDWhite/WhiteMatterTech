      <title>&#39;Split-Brain DNS&#39; for Internal HTTPS with Let&#39;s Encrypt</title>

      <description>Introduction In this previous post, I showed how to connect to a Unifi router with HTTPS, effectively ridding you of the tedious words, &amp;ldquo;Your connection is not private.&amp;rdquo; However, the method shown in that post directs your connection to an external DNS server (e.g., CloudFlare) in order to resolve your Unifi router. This adds some latency by requiring your traffic to flow out and in rather than staying local. Additionally, it requires opening some ports externally.</description>

      <description>Introduction Logging and traffic monitoring are of utmost importance in information security. Having searchable stored logs can allow visibility into a variety of critical activities related to a data breach.
For example, individual computer event logs can provide insight into an attacker&amp;rsquo;s lateral movement within an environment. Active Directory authentication logs can provide more detail into this lateral movement and even help to establish a timeline of this movement. Firewall logs can provide insight into an attacker&amp;rsquo;s first contact or the first time an attacker utilized a particular command or control domain.</description>

      <description>Interestingly, after my previous post describing how to route Docker containers through VPN on Unraid, I received a substantial lot of questions via email about my hints at accessing Twitter anonymously. This post is my response to those questions, and I will describe my workflow to access Twitter feeds anonymously, without an account.
This post will assume you have read my post on how to route Docker containers through VPN on Unraid or that you already know how to accomplish this.</description>

      <title>How to Route Any Docker Container Through VPN in Unraid</title>

      <guid>/posts/how-to-route-any-docker-container-through-vpn-in-unraid/</guid>
      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s post will cover how you can route any Docker container through a VPN.
There are many reasons you might want to route a Docker container through a VPN. Some common considerations are privacy, anonymity, and security.
I always recommend a VPN provider that values privacy, and in your search, you should consider providers that do not keep access logs that can be tied back to you (I use Private Internet Access [PIA]).</description>

      <description>For this post, I will show you how to easily run a Docker Registry GUI with Harbor. I am running Docker on a Ubuntu VM. Therefore, my registry will be run through Docker, and the container will reside on a Ubuntu VM. This tutorial will use docker-compose to build the required containers.
Download and Expand the Harbor Installer wget https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases/download/v2.3.1/harbor-offline-installer-v2.3.1.tgz tar -xzf harbor-offline-installer-v2.3.1.tgz cd harbor/ Generate SSL Certs - INTERNAL ONLY These steps should only be taken if you plan to use your registry internally.</description>

      <title>How to Easily Run A Reverse Proxy using Docker</title>
      <link>/posts/run-a-reverse-proxy-using-docker/</link>

      <description>Reverse proxies are powerful tools used typically to forward client traffic to a server. In contrast to a forward proxy, a reverse proxy sits in front of web servers or other servers and forwards client traffic to the appropriate server. In this post, I will show you how to easily setup a reverse proxy using Docker, forward the necessary ports to the reverse proxy, and configure the reverse proxy to forward traffic to various servers on your network.</description>

      <description>Update 03/20/2022: I no longer host my site with Traefik, and my site is no longer built on WordPress. I now host my site internally using an Nginx proxy hosted in Docker. My site is built with Hugo. Learn more about my transition from WordPress to Hugo on my post here: Migrating from WordPress to Hugo
  My first post will, appropriately, show you how to build your own self-hosted Wordpress site utilizing Docker (just like this site)!</description>
