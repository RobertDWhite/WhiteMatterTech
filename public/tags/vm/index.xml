      <description>Introduction OSSIM is a powerful open source security information and event management (SIEM) operating system. AlienVault OSSIM is the open source version of AlienVault, which is sold by AT&amp;amp;T.
I have used OSSIM in professional deployments in the past, and I currently use OSSIM for vulnerability scanning, asset management, and security alerts. OSSIM can often be overly complicated to set up and install, and the documentation available for troubleshooting is sparse.</description>

      <description>This post will show you how to run Tails OS as a VM with the Persistence feature enabled.
Running Tails as a VM is not recommended generally as it defeats many of the security features in Tails. For example, virtualization requires that you trust the hypervisor host, as the hypervisor has extra privileges over a VM that can reduce security and privacy of the VM.
I recommend reading Tails&amp;rsquo;s official documentation about virtualization considerations before continuing: https://tails.</description>

      <description>Introduction For this post, I will show you how to setup Unraid to run AlienVault OSSIM as a VM. OSSIM is a powerful open-source SIEM that you can leverage on your network for free. I use OSSIM for network-wide vulnerability scanning and endpoint host intrusion detection.
OSSIM&amp;rsquo;s integrated HIDS is a fork from OSSEC. Additionally, OSSIM integrates with Open Threat Exchange (OTX), which can be installed on Windows, Mac, and Linux endpoints and servers for an up-to-date, open-source vulnerability scanning tool.</description>
