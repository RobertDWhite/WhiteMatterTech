Otherwise, if you need a Microsoft Partner, hit us up. Visit wallaceandwhite.com or email us at info@wallaceandwhite.com\nInstructions  Backup your server. I used Veeam. Locate the Windows Server Setup media of the Win Server upgrade image, and then run setup.exe.  Select Yes to start the setup process. For internet-connected devices, select the Download updates, drivers and optional features [recommended] option, and then, select Next. Wait for the setup to check your device configuration, and then select Next. Depending on the distribution channel from where you received your Windows Server media (e.g., Retail, Volume License, OEM, ODM, etc.), you may be prompted to enter a licensing key to continue. Select the Windows Server edition you want to install and select Next. Select Accept to accept the terms of your licensing agreement, based on your distribution channel (e.g., Retail, Volume License, OEM, ODM, etc). Select Keep personal files and apps in order to do an in-place upgrade and then select Next.  After Setup analyzes your device, a prompt will appear to proceed with the upgrade by selecting Install.\nThe in-place upgrade starts and presents the Upgrading Windows screen showing its progress. After the upgrade finishes, the server will restart.\nConclusion It can certainly be intimidating to make these upgrades on production machines that your teams or business rely on daily, but Microsoft made this particular upgrade path pretty straightforward. As always, be sure you have a backup of your server before attempting such an upgrade. Nonetheless, you likely will not need it.\nCongratulations if you made it this far and everything is working! I hope this tutorial aids you in your endeavors to upgrade your servers to Windows Server 2022.
